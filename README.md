# Car Dealership Console App

## Overview
This project was part of my software development apprenticeship program. The requirements were to make a car dealership console application through the use of object-oriented programming. Within the program, I initialized a Car Dealership class and obtained an array of vehicle-like objects from a json file through the use of handling promises and fetching data. After getting the data, it is passed through factory.js to create instances of Cars, Trucks, ElectricVehicles and Motorcycles, which are classes that extend from a Vehicle class. As each vehicle is created they are added to the Dealership carLot property through a method on the Dealership class. The Dealership class and all Vehicle extended classes have methods that allow them to behave like a car dealership.

After I completed the basic requirements for the project, I started working on a mockup landing page to obtain more practice using HTML and CSS.
